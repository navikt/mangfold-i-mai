If you joined us in person in 2019 when Facebook visited NAV, you might remember that we introduced a system for finding accessibility defects on rendered Web pages. Well in the past 3 years, we extended this system to iOS And Android. Furthermore, we have introduced evaluation capabilities for Design and Usability in a toolchain that gathers the input from experts and presents the reviews in a fun, engaging way. Join us to learn how weâ€™re continuing to bring design thinking and inclusive thinking into a fast product development environment.
