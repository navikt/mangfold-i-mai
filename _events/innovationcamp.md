## What's the event about?
We wish to welcome you to the UD Day Innovation Camp that will take place on May 23 and 24th at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet). This event is part of NAVs «Mangfold i mai» event series and the «EQUALS-EU» project. EQUALS-EU aims to find solutions to make the tech and digital field more inclusive, especially for women.

The topic of the Innovation Camp is Universal Design of ICT. During the Innovation Camp, you will be familiarized with new ways of thinking about challenges, problems, and problem-solving through creative and engaging tasks. You will learn about efficient pitching methods, and explore new ways of working in teams.  

### What is an innovation camp?
An innovation camp is an event with interdisciplinary teams working on an effective solution. During innovation camps, the focus will be on creating new policies, business processes, practices, or products and services that solve complex challenges. It is common to present a challenge or a task that the groups can work towards or a set of challenges to select from. This task is somewhat related to the event's main topic, which is the universal design of ICT. 

During the day on the 23rd, mentors from both the public and private sector will support you in solving your chosen task and ask critical questions about issues that you might have overlooked.

On the 24th of May, we will have a pitching session where participants will present their solutions and the best solution will be selected.

The event language is English, as many of our mentors and jury members are English-speaking only. You are free to speak Norwegian in the groups if everyone in the group consents to do so.   

We have a code of conduct and request that everyone who participates at the event respects that.
