Universal Design Day is a day to raise awareness of the benefits of universal design for everyone and celebrate the positive influence of universal design in society. The event brings together the world's leading experts on universal design, representatives from local companies, and international institutions. This year the event will be a hybrid event located in Oslo, Norway, but also streamed over zoom.  
 
The day's program consists of three sessions: 

- **9:30 - 10:30.**  UD Innovation Camp project pitching and awards  
- **11:00 - 13:00.**  Diversity, inclusion, universal design projects, and design-relevant topics that are less tech-focused.
- **13:30 - 15:00.**  Universal design of information and communication technology.  More focus on the technical aspects of universal design.
 
We are still looking for speakers. You can [be a Guest Speaker](https://universal.design/udday22) at UD Day 2022 and contribute to shaping a universally designed world. The presentation can last between 5 and 15 minutes, and the topic is yours to decide.
  
Note: The event language is English, and the venue has limited seats. However, our zoom capacity is high. The seats are assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis, so whoever signs up first will get the available seats.
