09:00 - 10:30: Pitching og kåring av årets UD Day Innovation Camp vinnere
11:00 - 15:30: Ordinært program for UD Day 2022

Universal Design Day is a day to raise awareness of the benefits of universal design for everyone and celebrate the positive influence of universal design in society. The event brings together the world's leading experts on universal design, representatives from local companies, and international institutions. This year the event will be a hybrid event located in Oslo, Norway, but also streamed over zoom.  
 
The day's program consists of two sessions. The first session focuses on diversity, inclusion, universal design projects, and design-relevant topics that are less tech-focused. The second session is about the universal design of information and communication technology and focuses more on the technical aspects of universal design.
 
The first session is from 11.00 - 13.00
The second session is from 13:30 - 15:30
 
We are still looking for speakers. You can be a Guest Speaker at UD Day 2022 and contribute to shaping a universally designed world. The presentation can last between 5 and 15 minutes, and the topic is yours to decide.
