Eric Eggert is a Web Accessibility Expert with the goal of making the Web a better, more inclusive, place.

From 2013 to 2020 he worked with [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)’s [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) to improve documentation and educational material around web accessibility.

Then, he worked with [Knowbility](https://www.knowbility.org/) where he helmed the audit and training team as the Director of Accessibility Services in 2020 and 2021.

Since early 2022, he’s focusing on Europe and works with [Axess Lab](https://axesslab.com) towards the common goal of making digital products inclusive.

As a web developer, he understands the needs of developers but also knows about the big picture: Management, design, user interface, and UX decisions that pave the way to accessible websites and applications.
